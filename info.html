<h4>Why use anything else but 12edo?</h3>
<br>
<p>12edo is the prevalent tuning system in Western music today. In this paper, we will explore the history of Western tuning, as well as why 12edo is actually NOT the best tuning we can have.</p>
<p>This paper could be yours for just 50 cents!</p>
<br>
<h3>Other edo systems</h3>
<br>
<h4>31edo</h4>
<p>31edo is similar to the historically prevalent quarter-comma meantone, which equates four perfect fifths, octave-reduced, to the major 3rd.</p>
<p>Cost: 60 cents</p>
<br>
<h4>19edo</h4>
<p>19edo is another good candidate for meantone, as it has a near-just minor 3rd.</p>
<p>Cost: 50 cents</p>
<br>
<h4>17edo</h4>
<p>17edo is a great system for those interested in completely ignoring standard tonalities while making great melodies.</p>
<p>Cost: 55 cents</p>
<br>
<h4>13edo</h4>
<p>13edo is one of the most underused small edos. Having a step size slightly smaller than 12edo's, the intervals get weirder the further you get from the unison/octave.</p>
<p>Cost: $1.00</p>
<br>
<h4>14edo</h4>
<p>14edo is another good option for ditching standard tonalities, having a minor 3rd of 257 cents and a major 3rd of 429 cents.</p>
<p>Cost: 75 cents</p>
